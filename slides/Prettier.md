### An Opinionated Code Formatter

^ Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

# Prettier vs Linters

[.build-lists: true][.list: alignment(left)]

Linters have two categories of rules:

- Formatting rules: eg: max-len, no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs, comma-style...
- Code-quality rules: eg no-unused-vars, no-implicit-globals...

^ Prettier alleviates the need for this whole category of rules! Prettier is going to reprint the entire program from scratch in a consistent way, so it's not possible for the programmer to make a mistake there anymore :)

^ Prettier does nothing to help with those kind of rules. They are also the most important ones provided by linters as they are likely to catch real bugs with your code!
